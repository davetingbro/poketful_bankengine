###### Spot prize winner - Most Social Impact

This project was created during **New Zealand's first Open Banking Hackathon** organised by [BankEngine](https://bankengine.nz/).

## Bennie - Youth Payment Assistant

Use `npm install` & `npm start` to run the app or [click here](https://inspiring-beaver-ae1b7d.netlify.com/) to view deployed version.

You can use the following email for the authentication screen - `Danielle@youth.co.nz`
If BankEngine authentication api is no longer working, you can skip it by going to _/your-budget_ route

The app was desinged for the phone screen size, but will work perfectly fine on other screen sizes.
