Use `npm install` & `npm start` to run the app

You can use the following email for the authentication screen - **Danielle@youth.co.nz**
If BankEngine authentication api is no longer working, you can skip it by going to _/your-budget_ route

The app was desinged for the phone screen size, but will work perfectly fine on other screen sizes.
